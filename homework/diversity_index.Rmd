## Overview

In this exercise, we will calculate the **USA TODAY Diversity Index** for Maryland cities with a population of at least 10,000 using 2020 Census race and ethnicity data. The Diversity Index reflects the probability that two randomly selected individuals from a city are of different races or ethnicities.

A score of 0 indicates no diversity (everyone is the same race/ethnicity), while a score closer to 100 indicates higher diversity. The **most diverse city** has the highest index, reflecting a balanced mix of several racial and ethnic groups. The **least diverse** city likely has one overwhelmingly dominant racial/ethnic group.

## Task 1: Load and Describe the Data (3 points)

Run the following code to load the data, then examine it and describe what it contains. Based on the raw numbers alone, which cities stand out as diverse to you?

Based on the raw data, the most diverse cities are probably Baltimore City, Germantown,
Ellicot City, Wheaton and Columbia.

```{r load-data}
md_cities <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/usat_diversity_index.csv")

## Task 2: Calculate Race Percentages

```{r race-percentages}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    White_pct = White / TotalPop,
    Black_pct = Black / TotalPop,
    Native_pct = Native / TotalPop,
    Asian_pct = Asian / TotalPop,
    NHPI_pct = NHPI / TotalPop
  )
```

## Task 3: Square the Race Percentages

We need to square the race percentages in order to calculate the probability that any two people chosen at random from a given census area are of different races or are Hispanic or not.

```{r square-race}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    White_pct_sq = White_pct^2,
    Black_pct_sq = Black_pct^2,
    Native_pct_sq = Native_pct^2,
    Asian_pct_sq = Asian_pct^2,
    NHPI_pct_sq = NHPI_pct^2
  )
```


## Task 4: Calculate Race Probabilities (3 points)

The race probability is the sum the squared probabilities for each of the races. It represents the probability that two people randomly chosen from the same city will be of the same race. Which city has the highest race probability, and why do you think that is?

The city with the highest probability of people being randomly from the same race is Summerfield with a 0.87 probability. I believe this because 93% of its population is Black, making it a homogeneous community. 

```{r race-prob}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    Race_Prob = White_pct_sq + Black_pct_sq + Native_pct_sq + Asian_pct_sq + NHPI_pct_sq
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(Race_Prob))

View(md_cities)
```


## Task 5: Calculate Ethnicity Percentages and Their Squares (3 points)

Hispanic origin is not a race but an ethnicity or nationality â€“ and a separate Census question. The probability someone is Hispanic or not Hispanic must be calculated separately from race, and Hisp_Prob is the probability that two randomly selected people will be Hispanic or not. That's an important distinction, because unlike race probability, this measures the likelihood of a binary question: that both random people will be Hispanic. What do you notice about the cities with the *lowest* Hisp_Prob scores?

The top 3 cities with the lowest Hispanic Probability scores are Chillum (0.50), East Riverdale (0.51) and Wheaton (0.513) The cities with the lowest Hisp_Prob also have low race probabilities with Chillium (0.25), East Riverdale (0.28), and Wheaton (0.17). The three towns are also near the DC Metro area, with two of the towns in PG County and another in Montgomery County. 

```{r ethnicity}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    HispTotal = HISPANIC + NotHispanic,
    Hisp_pct = HISPANIC / HispTotal,
    NotHisp_pct = NotHispanic / HispTotal,
    Hisp_pct_sq = Hisp_pct^2,
    NotHisp_pct_sq = NotHisp_pct^2,
    Hisp_Prob = Hisp_pct_sq + NotHisp_pct_sq
  ) |> 
  arrange(Hisp_Prob)

View(md_cities)
```

## Task 6: Multiply Race and Ethnicity Probabilities

Here we multiply the two probabilities together to get the probability that any two random people have the SAME race and ethnicity.

```{r combined-prob}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    RaceEth_Prob = Race_Prob * Hisp_Prob
  )
```


## Task 7: Calculate Diversity Index (3 points)

The final step is to calculate the probability that two people randomly chosen WILL NOT BE OF THE SAME RACE OR ETHNICITY. In other words, the highest index scores will be cities where those two random people will be from different backgrounds. Put simply, more diverse. Which cities are the top 3, and where are they located? Look at the bottom of the list - which city is the least diverse, and where is it?

The top 3 cities with the most diversity is Langley Park (97), Wheaton (90.8) and Adelphi (90.04). 	
Lake Shore is the least diverse city in the state, which is located in Anne Arundel County.

```{r diversity-index}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    Diversity_Index = (1 - RaceEth_Prob) * 100
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(Diversity_Index))

View(md_cities)
```

### Pitch a story (8 points)

Given the data that you've produced here, write a headline and lede of the most interesting story from this exercise, and add below that details on how you would report it out: who you'd talk to and the questions you'd ask. When you describe the Diversity Index values, do so in a similar way to how USA Today did; the raw values themselves won't mean much to readers.

(POV: I'm writing this if I were the PG County reporter.)

Headline: Two Prince George's County Cities Ranked the Most Diverse in Md. 

Lede: Langley Park and Adelphi rank among the two most diverse cities in Maryland, according to 
the USA TODAY Diversity Index, which measures the possibility that any two random people would be
of a different race or ethnicity. 

The higher the number, the more diverse the population is in a city.

How Would I report it section:

a. I would interview the mayor, and other elected officials about the diversity in the town and how those different backgrounds are dealt with in the government. 
b. I would interview residents of this community about how its like living there and their experiences in a highly diverse area.
c. I would want to see events or community engagement activities that can help me illustrate to readers how this looks like.
